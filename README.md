# asteroids

This project is a part of the Boot.dev course. It is a simple implementation of the classic 
"Asteroids" game, employing and further developing my abiltiy to work with OOP principles
in Python. It uses the pygame module, and introduces concepts useful for keeping larger
projects organized. In this first iteration, only the basic requirements of the project are
implemented, but I might like to revisit this later to add some of the suggested ways to expand
on the project. I have built this game before, but it was fun to revisit it and see how much I
have grown since the last time!
